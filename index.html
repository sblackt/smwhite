      <h2>I'm a product design team leader living rurally in Ontario, Canada.</h2>
     <h3>What I'm up to</h3>
      <p>I currently lead the Product Design team at <a href="https://audienceview.com/">AudienceView</a> creating robust solutions for the ticketing industry, both for venues/event creators and users/ticket buyers.</p>
<p>What I do is create and support design teams to solve real problems and promote human centred design thinking across organizations.</p>
        <h3>Bio</h3>
<p>After practicing child and youth work in my first career, owning a contracting company in Vancouver, freelance designing in Toronto out of <a href="https://socialinnovation.org/">CSI Toronto</a> and working with the wild team over at <a href="https://elitedigitalagency.com/">Elite Digital</a> – I landed in design leadership at AudienceView. <br><br>I have 10 years of design experience spanning freelance, agency, in-house – branding, web, print and product UX/UI. Leveraging my initial career experience in social work I am a strong empathetic leader with a focus on facilitation and empowering professionals to do their job the best they can. I emphasize enjoying work and life through a love of design and it's process.<br><br>For organizations I believe design can and does provide key practices to set companies apart and create the right kind of value. A well run design team can prove value almost immediately in efficiencies and solutions using a human centred focus.
