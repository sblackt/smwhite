### What am I up to?

I currently lead the Product Design team at AudienceView creating robust solutions for the ticketing industry, both for venues/event creators and users/ticket buyers.

After practicing child and youth work in my first career, owning a contracting company in Vancouver, freelance designing in Toronto out of [CSI](https://socialinnovation.org/) and working with the wild team over at [Elite Digital](https://twitter.com/elitedigitalca?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) â€“ I landed in leadership at [AudienceView](https://www.audienceview.com/)

What I do is create and support design teams to solve real problems and promote human centred design thinking across organizations.
